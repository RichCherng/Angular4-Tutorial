# Angular 4 Tutorial
https://angular.io/guide/quickstart

Install [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Set up
Install Angular CLI globally
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli --unsafe
```
Bug: installing globally cause infinite loop, fixed by adding "--unsafe"

### Create a new Project
```bash
ng new my-app
```

### Serve the Application
```bash
cd my-app
ng serve --open
```
The `ng serve` launches the server, watches your files, and rebuilds the app as you make changes to those files

Using the `--open` (or just `o`) option will automatically open your browser on `http://localhost:4200/`.

| File        | Purpose           |
| ------------- 								|:-------------:| 
| app/app.component.{ts,html,css,spec.ts}      	| Defines the `AppComponent` along with an HTML template, CSS stylesheet, and a unit test. It is the root component of what will become a tree of nested components as the application evolves. |
| app/app.module.ts      						| Defines `AppModule`, the root module that tells Angular how to assemble the application. Right now it declares only the `AppComponent`. Soon there will be more components to declare.      | 
| assets/*								 | A folder where you can put images and anything else to be copies wholesale when you build your application.      |
| environments/*							| This folder contains one file for each of your destination environments, each exporting simple configuration variables to use in your application. The files are replaced on-the-fly when you build your app. You might use a different API endpoint for development than you do for production or maybe different analytics tokens. You might even use some mock services. Either way, the CLI has you covered.|
|favicon.ico								| Every site wants to look good on the bookmark bar. Get started with your very own Angular icon.|
| index.html								| The main HTML page that is served when someone visits your site. Most of the time you'll never need to edit it. The CLI automatically adds all js and css files when building your app so you never need to add any `<script>` or `<link>` tags here manually.|
| main.ts									| The main entry point for your app. Compiles the application with the JIT compiler and bootstraps the application's root module (`AppModule`) to run in the browser. You can also use the AOT compiler without changing any corde by passing in `--aot` to `ng build` or `ng serve`.|
| polyfills.ts								| Different browsers have different level of support of web standards. Polyfills help normalize those differences. You should be pretty safe with `core-js` and zone.js`.|
| styles.css								| Your global styles go here. Most of the time you'll want to have local styles in your components for easier maintenance, but styles that affect all of your app need to be in a central place.|
| test.ts 									| This is the main entry point for your unit tests. It has some custom configuration that might be unfamiliar, but it's not something you'll need to edit.|
| tsconfig.\{app spec}.json					| TypeScript compiler configuration for the Angular app (`tsconfig.app.json`) and for the unit tests (`tsconfig.spec.json`).|



| File 		| 	Purpose |
| ------------------|:------------------:|
|e2e/		| Inside `e2e/` live the end-to-end tests. They shouldn't be inside `src/` because e2e tests are really a separate app that jsut so happens to test your main app. That's also why they have their own `tsconfig.e2e.json`.|
| node_modules/	| `Node.js` creates this folder and put all third party modules listed in `package.json` inside of it.|
|.angular-cli.json	| Configuration for Angular CLI. In this file you can set several defaults and also configure what files are included when your project is built. Check out the official documentation if you want to know more.|
| .editorconfig		| Simple configuration for your editor to make sure everyone that uses your project has the same basic configuration. Most editors support an `.editorconfig` file. See http://editorconfig.org for more information.|
| .gitignore		| Git configuration to make sure autogenerated files are not commited to source control.|
| karma.conf.js	| Unit test configuration for the Karma test runner, used when running ng test.|
| package.json 	| `npm` configuration listing the third party packages your project uses. You can also add your own custom script [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts). |
| protractor.conf.js	| End-to-end test configuration for [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/#/), used when running `ng e2e`.|
| README.md		| Basic documentation for your project, pre-filled with CLI command information. Make sure to enhance it with project documentation so that anyone checking out the repo can build your app!|
| tsconfig.json		| TypeScript compiler configuration for your IDE to pick up and give you helpful tooling.|
| tslint.json		| Linting configuration for [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) together with [Codelyzer](http://codelyzer.com/), used when running `ng lint`. Linting helps keep your code style consistent.|
